CLEAN MIND TODO LIST
As my first project using React, I set out to create something simple that would not only allow me to dive into React's core functionalities but also enable me to explore Material UI documentation.

Features:
Add Tasks using a modal form.
Clear Modal Form upon submission.
Allows the user to delete, edit or toggle task state as todo or completed.
